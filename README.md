### Minimal Jupyter Notebook Theme
Personal theme that I use for Jupyter notebooks. It uses a chromatic palette similar to the popular solarized theme with excellent contrast against white background. Classic latex font - "Computer Modern" is used for body text to give it a professional/academic look. No official jupyter logo. Includes dataframe table formatting, matplotlib style, and a number of aesthetic updates to ensure clean, sophisticated and purposeful presentation. If you find errors or ways to improve, please submit and issue or a pull-request.

### Installation instructions
Create a new directory `".jupyter/custom"`[1] in your home folder if it doesn't exist.
Copy the contents of this repository to the `.jupyter/custom"` folder such that `custom.css` file is located at `.jupyter/custom/custom.css`. If this method doesn't work, see [2].

[1] Custom directory can be found by launching Jupyter notebook and using the following commands:
```
import jupyter_core
jupyter_core.paths.jupyter_config_dir() + '\\custom'
```
For more information, see this Stackoverflow post: ![Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32156248/how-do-i-set-custom-css-for-my-ipython-ihaskell-jupyter-notebook)

[2] Launch jupyter notebook with a python kernel and type the following commands:
```
from distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib
print(get_python_lib())
```
Try placing the custom.css such that it is located at:
`/Users/Username/miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/notebook/static/custom/custom.css`
